    <h1>Return and Variance Models</h1>

    <p>
      Before starting, it is important to keep in mind that whatever
      technique is used to measure the performance of assets, the resulting model is
      essentially phenomenological, without no physical laws to support predictions.
      In that sense, simplicity and interpretability go a long way in producing a useful
      and effective model.
    </p>

    <p>
      The models used for portfolio optimization by the
      <a href="https://optimize.vicbee.net/optimize/api/ui">Optimize API</a>
      are expected return and variance asset models.
      See references [<a href="#ref1">1</a>-<a href="#ref1">3</a>] and this
      <a href="./portfolio.html">case study</a> for details.
      In such models, an asset return is represented by two quantities:
      the <em>expected return</em>, \( \mu_i \), and its <em>variance</em>,
      \( \sigma_i^2 \), that is
      $$
        \begin{aligned}
          \mu_{i} &= E \{ r_i \}, &
          \sigma_i^2 = c_{i,i} &= E \{ (r_i - \mu_i)^2 \}.
        \end{aligned}
      $$
      With more than one asset, we add to the model the <em>correlation</em> between
      each asset,
      $$
        c_{i,j} = E \{ (r_i - \mu_i) (r_j - \mu_j) \}.
      $$
    </p>

    <p>
      The expected return and variance of a portfolio is then optimized by evaluating
      $$
        \begin{aligned}
          \mu(\theta) &= \sum_{i} \theta_i \, \mu_i, &
          \sigma^2(\theta) &= \sum_{i, j} c_{i, j} \, \theta_i \, x_j,
        \end{aligned}
      $$
      in which \( \theta_i \) is the asset's weight on the portfolio (more on portfolio
      weights and some not so obvious caveats <a href="#portfolios">below</a>).
    </p>

    <p>
      For a given portfolio, expected return and variance for each asset and their
      covariances can be estimated by the
      <a href="https://optimize.vicbee.net/models/api/ui">Models API</a>.
      This note goes over some important aspects that need to be taken into account
      when estimating returns and variances and their use in portfolio optimization.
    </p>

    <h2>Historic Asset Prices</h2>

    <p>
      Expected returns and their variances are typically estimated from historic price
      series<sup style="font-size:xx-small">[<a href="#note1">1</a>]</sup>.
      As the number of parameters to be estimated grows with the square
      of the size of the number of assets in the portfolio, so does the demand on data
      and the uncertainty about those estimates.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this case study, we highlight some difficulties involved in the estimation of
      expected returns and variances. From the choice of return series to use to the
      methodology employed to calculate the estimates, it is quite easy to
      get astray and end up with models that are not very representative.
    </p>

    <p>
      To make the discussion concrete, we shall work with two particular assets: NVDA and
      TQQQ. Their adjusted<sup style="font-size:xx-small">[<a href="#note2">2</a>]</sup>
      price series, retrieved and calculated over the course of the last five years at
      the time of this note writing, October 2024, is shown in the plots below.
    </p>

    <div class="right">
      <img height="220" src="figs/nvda1.png" alt="NVDA"/>
    </div>
    <div class="right">
      <img height="220" src="figs/tqqq1.png" alt="NVDA"/>
    </div>

    <p>
      As so much has happened within the last five years, this is a very
      interesting period to study. As for singling out these two
      assets, NVDA seems an obvious choice given its recent incredible exponential
      growth, while TQQQ displays some interesting ups-and-downs.
    </p>

    <h2>Daily Returns</h2>

    <p>
      A naive approach to estimating the return of assets is to calculate the
      statistics of the <em>daily returns</em>. If \( p[k] \) denotes the price of an asset
      at day \( k \), then
    </p>

    <div class="right">
      <img height="220" src="figs/tqqq2.png" alt="TQQQ"/>
    </div>

    <p>
      $$
        r[k] = \frac{p[k] - p[k-1]}{p[k-1]}
      $$
      is the corresponding <em>daily return</em>.
      For TQQQ, the corresponding series of daily returns is ploted on the right.
    </p>

    <p>
      For each series of daily returns we calculate the sample mean (\( \hat{\mu} \)) and
      sample standard deviation (\( \hat{\sigma} \)).
      In the daily return plot, the solid line is the mean and the dashed lines are
      the corresponding 3-\( \sigma \) intervals.
    </p>

    <p>
      Without putting much thought into it,
      notice that the estimated mean return is expected to be tiny when compared with the
      variance of the daily returns, which can make its estimation tricky. Before
      proceeding, we take a look at the histogram of the daily return series
      to assess how close to <em>normal</em> or at least symmetrically distributed
      it looks, as a way to support the use of the simple statistics above. The
      histogram, shown in the next plot, does not immediately raises suspicions.
    </p>

    <div class="right">
      <img height="220" src="figs/tqqq3.png" alt="TQQQ"/>
    </div>

    <p>
      If we substitute the daily return by its expected value, that is
      \( r[k] = \mu \), then we are implicitly assuming that \( p[k] \) evolves as
      $$
         p[k] = (1 + \mu) \, p[k-1]
      $$
      or, in other words, that the price evolution is the exponential
      $$
         p[k] = (1 + \mu)^k \, p[0].
      $$
      Substituting \( \mu \) for the estimated sample mean \( \hat{\mu} \) and
      superimposing the resulting exponential to the price series we obtain the
      plot on the right, in which the predicted price estimated by the model is
      the orange solid curve.
    </p>

    <div class="right">
      <img height="220" src="figs/tqqq4.png" alt="TQQQ"/>
    </div>

    <p>
      It is striking how the above estimate fails to match the original price behaviour.
      One may attempt to improve the model by looking at other statistics of the daily returns,
      for one example, the median.
      No matter how one tries to massage the series of daily returns into producing a
      return model which looks reasonable when compared with the evolution of the price,
      one will always find an asset for which the model quality is subpar.
      In order to obtain better models we need to work directly with prices.
    </p>

    <h2>Prices, Returns, and the Power of Log</h2>

    <p>
      Estimating returns based on simple aggregate statistics of the daily
      return series turned out not to be a good idea.
      For one thing, the mean or any other aggregate statistic of the daily returns do
      not take into account <em>when</em> that return happened. In fact, if one permutes
      the daily returns, one would still obtain the same aggregate statistics, but yet
      completely different price series.
    </p>

    <p>
      It also happens that knowing how an asset performed on a particular day in the past
      is not very informative when it comes to assessing the asset's performance measured
      with respect to today's price. What an investor cares to
      know is how much one would have <em>today</em> if he or she had invested at a certain
      point in time. That is not the series of daily returns, but rather the series of
      <em>compound returns as measured from any point in time until today</em>. If we
      let \( p[n] \) denote the price of the asset today, then what we are after is the
      value of \( r_n[k] \) such that
      $$
        p[n] = \left ( 1 + r_n[k] \right )^{n-k} p[k], \qquad k < n.
      $$
      Due to the multiplicative nature of returns, it is easier to work with the
      <em>logarithm</em> of the prices, rather than with the prices. More specifically,
      it is better to work with the much simpler quantity
      $$
        a[k] = \log(1 + r_n[k]) = \frac{\log p[k] - \log p[n]}{k - n}, \qquad k < n.
      $$
    </p>

    <p>
      For more insight, one can rearrange the above equation into the form
      $$
        \log p[k] = \log p[n] + a[k] \, (k - n)
      $$
      which, for a constant \( a[k] = \mu_{a} \), can be identified with an equation of the form
      $$
        y = y_n + \mu_{a} \, (x - x_n).
      $$
      This is a line with slope \( \mu_{a} \) that passes through the point \( (x_n, y_n) \). Indeed,
      \( y = y_n \) when \( x = x_n \).
      In terms of the log-price,
    </p>

    <div class="right">
      <img height="220" src="figs/tqqq5.png" alt="TQQQ"/>
      <img height="220" src="figs/tqqq6.png" alt="TQQQ"/>
    </div>

    <p>
      $$
        \underbrace{\log p[k]}_{y} = \underbrace{\log p[n]}_{y_n} + \mu_{a} \, (\underbrace{k - n}_{x - x_n}).
      $$
    </p>

    <p>
      The above discussion provides a different perspective from which to estimate an
      asset's return: as the slope of the best fit line that goes by today's price in
      logarithmic scale.
    </p>

    <p>
      Such an estimate can be obtained by performing a standard linear regression.
      The plot on the right show the result of such a fit for our favorite
      asset, TQQQ, which is much more sensible than the one obtained before from the
      statistics of the daily returns.
    </p>

    <p>
      From logarithmic scale, we can convert back to linear scale in order to
      obtain the corresponding exponential model, shown in the plot on the right,
      which also looks very reasonable.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a bonus, the linear fit interpretation comes with built-in estimates for the
      variance of the estimated slopes, which we can adopt as estimates for the asset
      return variance. One caveat here is that those estimates are obtained in
      logarithmic scale, and they need to be properly translated back into linear scale
      for use in portfolio optimization.
      In the same vein, it is not immediately clear how to proceed on estimating the
      correlation between assets, or to construct
      <em>factor models</em><sup style="font-size:xx-small">[<a href="#note3">3</a>,<a href="#note4">4</a>]</sup>.
      All of these <i>details</i> are taken care by the algorithms implemented in the
      <a href="https://optimize.vicbee.net/models/api/ui">Models API</a>.
      In translating from logarithmic scale to linear and <em>vice-versa</em>, the
      algorithms in
      <a href="https://optimize.vicbee.net/models/api/ui">Models API</a>
      employ the formalism of log-normal models <a href="#ref3">[3, \( \S \)16.7]</a>.
    </p>

    <div class="right">
      <img height="220" src="figs/nvda5.png" alt="NVDA"/>
    </div>
    <div class="right">
      <img height="220" src="figs/nvda6.png" alt="NVDA"/>
    </div>

    <p>
      As a sanity check, we repeat the above exercise for a second asset, this time NVDA,
      which results in the logarithmic and exponential fits on the plots on the right,
      which shows even better results.
    </p>

    <h2 id="portfolios">The Return of Portfolios</h2>

    <p>
      Having found a satisfactory ways in which to estimate returns and variances of
      individual assets, we now turn to the problem of using such models for optimizing
      portfolios. It is worth clearly stating our fairly modest goals.
      We are after two numbers, the elusive expected return and its variance, which
      represent the performance of the portfolio based on estimates of the returns and
      covariances of the individual assets in that portfolio.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whereas one might be tempted to simply plugging in the estimated assets' return
      and covariance into the portfolio optimization model, it is important to pay
      attention to one missing ingredient: the investor's <em>investment horizon</em>.
      At a minimum, it is important to match the periodicity with which the estimates
      were calculated to the investor investment horizon.
      The expected daily return and variance might mean little for an investor who
      is not interested in trading daily! It is necessary to take into account the
      effects of <em>long-term</em> investing <a href="#ref3">[3, \( \S \)10]</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Consider a portfolio with \( m \) assets. Over time, the portfolio
      is priced at
      $$
        \pi[k] = \sum_{i = 1}^{m} x_i[k],
      $$
      in which \( x_i[k] \) is the value of the \( i \)th asset at day \( k \).
      If the number of shares of each asset in a portfolio is kept constant and equal
      to today's number of shares, then
      $$
        x_i[k] = \frac{p_i[k]}{p_i[n]} x_i[n], \qquad \text{for all } i \text{ and } k,
      $$
      in which \( p_i[k] \) is the price of each share of the \( i \)th asset at day
      \( k \). In that case
      $$
      \begin{aligned}
        \frac{\pi[k]}{\pi[n]} &= \sum_{i = 1}^{m} \theta_i \frac{p_i[k]}{p_i[n]}, \qquad
        \theta_i = \frac{x_i[n]}{\pi[n]} \geq 0, \quad \sum_{i = 1}^m \theta_i = 1.
      \end{aligned}
      $$
      The \( \theta_i \)'s are the <em>portfolio weights</em>. Clearly, it only makes
      sense to optimize portfolio weights if one also knows how long the investor is
      expected to keep the portfolio shares constant, that is if we know the
      <em>investment horizon</em>. Moreover, the impact of holding a portfolio constant
      is inexorable: in the <em>long term</em>, the portfolio becomes the asset with the
      highest return <a href="#ref3">[3, \( \S \) 10]</a>. How long is
      &ldquo;long-term&rdquo; depends heavily on the composition of the portfolio as
      well as the investment horizon, but the compounding of daily returns usually means
      that one month might be already long-term when it comes to returns and their
      covariances.
    </p>

    <p>
      As with individual assets, it is better to evaluate the return of portfolios in
      the log-domain
      $$
      \begin{aligned}
        \alpha[k] &= \frac{\log \pi[k] - \log \pi[n]}{k - n}
        =
        \frac{\log \sum_{i = 1}^{m} \theta_i \, (p_i[k]/p_i[n])}{k - n}
        =
        \frac{\log \sum_{i = 1}^{m} \theta_i \, e^{a_i[k] (k-n)}}{k - n}.
      \end{aligned}
      $$
      Note that the portfolio return over time, \( \alpha[k] \), is never constant, even if
      the individual assets' returns, the \( a_i \)'s, were constant, which is another
      way to state the impact of long-term holdings mentioned above.
      A better measure of the portfolio return over a given investment horizon, say
      a horizon of \( q \) days, is
      $$
        \mu[n+q]
        =
        \sum_{i = 1}^{m} \theta_i \, \mu_i[n+q],
        \qquad
        \mu_i[n+q]
        =
        e^{q \, a_i[n+1]} - 1.
      $$
    </p>
    <p>
      After the above discussion, it seems paramount that one adjusts the individual
      assets' expected return and variance before attempting to optimize a portfolio.
      It is for this reason that the models produced by the
      <a href="https://optimize.vicbee.net/models/api/ui">Models API</a>,
      have their returns and covariances adjusted to match a given investment horizon.

<!--      $$-->
<!--      which means that simply combining the historic logarithmic return estimates usually-->
<!--      leads to overestimating the return of the portfolio.-->
    </p>

    <p>
      That's enough for today.
      We shall continue discussing models here in future case studies.

        Estimating all covariance parameters in large-scale portfolios is a tricky task.
        More often than not, optimal portfolios end up exploiting features of the
        covariance matrix that end up in the model via uncertainties in the estimation
        procedure. Factor models reduce the need to estimat all covariance parameters
        by structuring the returns as a function of a reduced set of <em>factors</em>,
        which can be thought of playing a proxy role for a diversified
        <em>market portfolio</em>. One such typical structure is in the form
        $$
           C = C_\alpha + \beta \, C_f \, \beta^T.
        $$
        In the above model, \( C_\alpha \) is usually a diagonal matrix, and the covariance
        matrix \( C_f \) is the covariance matrix of the factors.
        See the next note for more details in how those matrices are constructed.
      </li>
      <li id="note4">
        Factor models are typically obtained by first establishing a relationship
        between the assets and the factors. For example,
        $$
          r_i = \alpha_i + \sum_{k} \beta_{i,k} f_k + \epsilon_i
        $$
        expresses a linear relationship between the return of the \( i \)th asset and
        the <em>factors</em> \( f_k \)'s. The coefficient \( \alpha_i \) represents the
        <em>intrinsic</em> or <em>unsystematic</em> portion of the returns,
        whereas the \( \beta_{i,j} \)'s represent the <em>systematic</em> part.
        Here again, logarithms complicate things, and one needs to be careful in
        calculating model estimates.
