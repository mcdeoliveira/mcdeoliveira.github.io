    <h1>Large Scale Portfolio Modelling and Optimization</h1>

    <p>
      VICBee brings its experience in developing models and algorithms to optimize
      portfolios for one of the worlds' largest sovereign wealth funds into the design
      of its <a href="https://optimize.vicbee.net/optimize/api/ui">Optimize API</a> and
      <a href="https://optimize.vicbee.net/models/api/ui">Models API</a>. The result is
      an interface that can be used to model and optimize portfolios from a few dozen
      assets to several thousand assets. Please visit our other case studies to
      learn more about the importance of <a href="models.html">carefully crafting models</a>
      and the role of <a href="portfolio.html">constraints in portfolio optimization</a>.
      In the rest of this note we shall provide some details behind the technical design
      of our APIs.
    </p>

    <h2>Architecture and Deployment</h2>

    <p>
      Our APIs are designed around the concept of
      <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/microservices/design/api-design">microservices</a>
      which can be easily deployed in a cloud environment.
      The splitting of responsibilities between
      modelling, in the <a href="https://optimize.vicbee.net/models/api/ui">Models API</a>,
      and optimization, in the
      <a href="https://optimize.vicbee.net/optimize/api/ui">Optimize API</a>, is the
      facet of this design that is most evident to our users.
      What that means is that we can easily deploy and scale our services to meet
      client's needs. For some costumers, it may be enough to subscribe for access to our
      public facing services. Others however, may demand a complete deployment in their
      secure private cloud environment.
    </p>

    <h2>REST APIs and User Information</h2>

    <p>
      Our APIs adhere to the concept of
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST">REST</a>.
      Besides all the clarity and flexibility that it brings to users, there are
      other reasons that we believe make REST perfect for finance applications.
      One is that every call to one of our REST API methods contains only the
      information it needs to solve the problem at hand. Consequently, there is no need
      to store or manipulate sensitive costumer information. In fact, our APIs do not
      store or identify any information it processes.
    </p>

    <p>
      To see how this works in practice, consider the typical flow of
      information depicted in the following diagram:
    </p>

    <div>
      <script type="text/tikz">
        \tikzset{>=latex}
        \tikzstyle{block} = [draw, fill=white, rectangle, minimum height=3em, minimum width=6em, rounded corners=5pt]
        \begin{tikzpicture}[font=\sffamily]
          \node [align=center] (user) {user \\ application};
          \node [align=center, above=8em of user] (rest) {REST APIs};
          \draw [rounded corners=2pt, fill=blue!90!black, opacity=.1] (user) ++(-1cm,-.5cm) rectangle ++(21cm,1.75cm);
          \draw [rounded corners=2pt, fill=green!90!black, opacity=.1] (rest) ++(-1cm,-.5cm) rectangle ++(21cm,1.75cm);
          \node [block, align=center, right=6em of user, yshift=1em] (initial) {initial \\ portfolio};
          \node [block, align=center, right=3em of initial, yshift=10em] (models) {historical models \\ \texttt{Models API}};
          \node [block, align=center, right=3em of models, yshift=-10em] (constraints) {user \\ constraints};
          \node [block, align=center, right=3em of constraints, yshift=10em] (optimize) {optimization \\ \texttt{Optimize API}};
          \node [block, align=center, right=3em of optimize, yshift=-10em] (final) {final \\ portfolio};
          \draw[->] (initial) -- (models) node[left, pos=0.5, xshift=-1em, align=center]{tickers \& \\ ranges};
          \draw[->] (models) -- (constraints) node[left, pos=0.5, align=center, xshift=-1em]{return \& \\ covariance};
          \draw[->] (constraints) -- (optimize) node[left, pos=0.5, align=center, xshift=-.5em]{model, \\ constraints \& \\ cashflow};
          \draw[->] (optimize) -- (final) node[left, pos=0.5, align=center, xshift=-1em]{optimal \\ portfolio};
        \end{tikzpicture}
      </script>
    </div>

    <p>
      When building a model, the
      <a href="https://optimize.vicbee.net/models/api/ui">Models API</a> does not need
      to know, for example, how much one owns of a particular asset, or the total value
      of the portfolio.
    </p>

    <p>
      Likewise, what is passed to
      <a href="https://optimize.vicbee.net/optimize/api/ui">Optimize API</a> for
      optimization is a set of mathematical models and constraints, which contains as
      little information as needed to optimize the user portfolio.
      For example, no tickers are necessary. Of course, at this point, the optimizer
      would need to know about the initial portfolio, as part of the constraints,
      but even this information can be stated in relative rather than absolute terms,
      if privacy is a concern, such that all sensitive information remains in the user
      application layer.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another advantage of REST is the ease with which one can incorporate the
      functionality into their applications. The APIs use standard HTTP methods and
      protocols which are universally supported. Access is controlled via
      <em>access tokens</em> and a
      <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pyoptimum">support library</a> is
      available to facilitate access in Python.
    </p>

    <h2>Large Portfolios</h2>

    <p>
      When it comes to large scale portfolio optimization, it is not possible to
      strictly adhere to the fast response times of the REST paradigm because of the
      large time required to process data and perform optimization. Developing
      historical models and optimizing portfolios with thousands of assets takes more
      than the typical few seconds we have become used to when interacting with web
      applications.
    </p>

    <p>
      With those cases in mind, the
      <a href="https://optimize.vicbee.net/models/api/ui">Models API</a> and
      <a href="https://optimize.vicbee.net/optimize/api/ui">Optimize API</a>
      defer calculations of large portfolio models according to the
      <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/async-request-reply">
        Asynchronous Request-Reply pattern
      </a>.
      A typical example, in this case for the
      <a href="https://optimize.vicbee.net/models/api/ui">Models API</a>,
      is illustrated in the following diagram:
    </p>

    <div>
    <script type="text/tikz">
      \tikzset{>=latex}
      \tikzstyle{block} = [draw, fill=white, rectangle, minimum height=3em, minimum width=6em, rounded corners=5pt]
      \begin{tikzpicture}[font=\sffamily]
        \node [align=center] (user) {user \\ application};
        \node [align=center, above=8em of user] (rest) {Models API};
        \draw [rounded corners=2pt, fill=blue!90!black, opacity=.1] (user) ++(-1cm,-.5cm) rectangle ++(21cm,1.75cm);
        \draw [rounded corners=2pt, fill=green!90!black, opacity=.1] (rest) ++(-1cm,-.5cm) rectangle ++(21cm,1.75cm);
        \node [block, align=center, right=2em of user, yshift=1em] (initial) {initial \\ portfolio};
        \node [block, align=center, right=2em of initial, yshift=10em] (models) {\verb+/model+};
        \node [block, align=center, right=3em of models] (resource_status) {\verb+/resource/{id}/status+};
        \node [block, align=center, below=7em of resource_status] (resource_management) {resource \\ management};
        \node [block, align=center, right=3em of resource_status] (resource_value) {\verb+/resource/{id}/value+};
        \node [block, align=center, right=2em of resource_value, yshift=-10em] (constraints) {user \\ constraints};
        \draw[->] (initial) -- (models) node[left, pos=0.5, align=center]{tickers \& \\ ranges};
        \draw[->] (models) -- (resource_management) node[left, pos=0.5, xshift=-1em, align=center]{id};
        \draw[->] (resource_value) -- (constraints) node[right, pos=0.5, align=center, xshift=1em]{return \& \\ covariance};
        \path[->] (resource_management) edge[bend right] node [left] {} (resource_status);
        \path[<-] (resource_management) edge[bend left] node [left] {} (resource_status);
        \draw[->] (resource_management) -- (resource_value);
        \draw [dashed] (initial) ++(1.5cm,-1.1cm) rectangle ++(12.8cm,5.75cm);
      \end{tikzpicture}
    </script>
    </div>

    <p>
      In a nutshell, for large portfolios, instead of the user application waiting a
      long time to obtain a return and covariance model from the <tt>/model</tt> API
      entrypoint, it obtains instead an <em>id</em> for the associated <em>resource</em>,
      while it is still being calculated. The user application then uses the
      <tt>/resouce/{id}/status</tt> entrypoint to obtain status updates and, when the
      resource finally becomes available, the
      <tt>/resouce/{id}/value</tt> entrypoint for retriving the calculation result, in
      this case the return and covariance model.
    </p>

    <p>
      All happens <em>asynchronously</em> within the confines of the same REST API
      interface, giving the user application the ability to do other things while
      waiting for the long calculation result to materialize.
      If using our Python
      <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pyoptimum">support library</a>, all such
      operations, the ones inside the dashed rectangle above, can be made completely
      transparent to the user while taking advantage of Python's
      <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html">asyncio</a> facilities.
    </p>

    <h2>User Applications</h2>

    <p>
      Finally, when it comes to user applications, we can either support the development
      of user applications that incorporate out APIs, or develop and deploy
      complete applications to meet our costumers' needs. We have demo applications that
      showcase the main features of our interfaces that can be
      made available for trial <a href="contact.html">upon request</a>.
