    <h1>Large Scale Portfolio Optimization</h1>

    <p>
      VICBee has developed models and continue working on algorithms
      to optimize portfolios involving several thousands of assets to
      one of the worlds' largest sovereign wealth funds.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The main goal is to take into account the clients' own trading
      environment and strategic investment constraints while being
      able to handle portfolios with more than five thousand assets.
    </p>

    <p>
      Objectives include tracking performance indices and maximizing
      expected return under risk constraints over single or multiple
      investment periods.
    </p>

    <p>
      VICBee developed mathematical models and software that were
      incorporated by the client in their existing set of tools to
      optimize the allocation of assets in large portfolios with a
      number of practical constraints. These constraints include
      strategic investment guidelines, limiting the number of small or
      very large trades, liquidity considerations, and scheduling
      transactions over a finite investment horizon. 
    </p>

      studies</a> for a brief discussion on the determination of the
      efficient frontier in constrained portfolios.
