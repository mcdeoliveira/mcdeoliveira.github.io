    <h1>The Efficient Frontier in Constrained Portfolios</h1>

    <p>
      A fundamental concept in portfolio optimization is that of
      the <em>Efficient Frontier</em>, which is the set of all
      portfolios that minimize a measure of risk while guaranteeing a
      certain level of return. By far the most studied and well
      understood case is that of minimum variance portfolios, which
      dates back to <a href="#ref2">Markowitz [1952]</a>. When no
      constraints on the expected return or the variance of the
      expected return of groups or the total number of assets is
      present, the determination of the optimum portfolios can be done
      through an analytic formula, a fact that facilitates the
      development and discussion of its many properties.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The case when constraints on groups of assets is present is much
      less understood, mainly because no analytic formula for the
      optimum portfolio can be derived. The following discussion is
      meant to illustrate the beneficial role that can be played by
      such constraints in portfolio optimization. It does not contain
      proofs and the technical aspects of the problems been solved are
      omitted.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In a nutshell, the message is that while unconstrained
      portfolios are easier to compute, they will more than often rely
      heavily on leverage to finance its holdings. The introduction of
      additional constraints, although complicating the optimization
      problem to be solved, can effectively control that level of
      leverage and help shape the desired portfolio without
      significantly increasing the associated level of risk.
    </p>

    <h2>The Efficient Frontier</h2>
    
    <p>
      We keep this discussion simple by adopting the variance of
      expected returns a measure of risk of the
      portfolio. See <a href="#ref2">Markowitz [1952]</a> or, for
      instance, <a href="#ref2">Elton and Gruber [1995]</a> for a more
      modern presentation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Given a set of assets, their expected returns and the complete
      covariance matrix, an optimum portfolio is therefore one that
      minimizes the portfolio variance while guaranteeing a certain
      rate of expected return. As stated, one can cast such portfolio
      optimization problem as a convex quadratic program
      (<a href="#ref3">Boyd and Vandenberghe [2004]</a>). In its
      simplest version, without constraints, an analytic formula can
      be obtained for the computation of the optimum portfolio
      (<a href="#ref2">Elton and Gruber [1995]</a>).
    </p>

    <p>
      In order to illustrate optimum portfolios under a variety of
      constraints we will use the fictitious data
      from <a href="#ref2">Elton and Gruber [1995]</a>, Chapter 6, p
      106.  It consists of a small portfolio with 8 classes of
      segmented global assets. The expected returns and standard
      deviation of the return of such assets are given in the
      following table:
    </p>
    
    <table>
      <thead>
	<tr>
	  <th/>
	  <th>S & P</th>
	  <th>Bonds</th>
	  <th>Canadian</th>
	  <th>Japan</th>
	  <th>Emerging Markets</th>
	  <th>Pacific</th>
	  <th>Europe</th>
	  <th>Small Stocks</th>
	</tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
	<tr>
	  <th>Expected return</th>
	  <td>14.0</td><td>6.5</td><td>11.0</td><td>14.0</td>
	  <td>16.0</td><td>18.0</td><td>12.0</td><td>17.0</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <th>Standard deviation</th>
	  <td>18.5</td><td>5.0</td><td>16.0</td><td>23.0</td>
	  <td>30.0</td><td>26.0</td><td>20.0</td><td>24.0</td>
	</tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      The correlation coefficients which can be used to assemble the
      complete covariance matrix can be found in <a href="#ref2">Elton
      and Gruber [1995]</a> or by
      <a href="cov.txt">clicking here</a>.
      With this information in hand one can trace the efficient frontier
      by varying the expected return to obtain the plot in the next
      figure:
    </p>
    
    <img height="600" src="frontier1.jpg" alt="Efficient frontier"/>

    <p>
      The figure displays only a segment of the efficient frontier,
      the red solid curve, along with all assets and their respective
      return and standards deviations. It is clear that the main
      advantage of portfolio optimization, which selects assets on the
      efficient frontier, is to provide a significant reduction in
      risk at any level of return. This feature comes however loaded
      with some caveats. In the next sections we will discuss how some
      of these caveats can be mitigated by improving the quality of
      the underlying model with the introduction of additional
      constraints.
    </p>

    <p>
      We now enlist two caveats. First, optimum portfolios in the
      unconstrained frontier can be very sensitive to the quality of
      the model, here specially the
      accuracy<sup style="font-size:xx-small"><a href="#note1">[1]</a></sup>
      of the covariance matrix. Second, under the absence of other
      constraints, the efficient frontier extends <em>ad
      infinitum</em>, and one could theoretically extract any level of
      return from this portfolio, often at the expense of much
      leveraging. For instance, pick a given level of return,
      say&nbsp;14%, which is the expected return of the S&P assets,
      and take a closer look at its associated optimum portfolio
      weights:
    </p>
    
    <table>
      <thead>
	<tr>
	  <th/>
	  <th>S&P</th>
	  <th>Bonds</th>
	  <th>Canadian</th>
	  <th>Japan</th>
	  <th>Emerging</th>
	  <th>Pacific</th>
	  <th>Europe</th>
	  <th>Small</th>
	  <th>Standard deviation</th>
	  <th>Leverage</th>
	</tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
	<tr>
	  <th>(%)</th>
	  <td>5.3</td><td>36.9</td><td style="color:red">-3.6</td><td>6.9</td>
	  <td style="color:red">-12.0</td><td>33.7</td><td style="color:red">-11.5</td><td>44.2</td>  
	  <td>12.9</td><td style="color:red">27.1</td>
	</tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      The above weights are associated with the optimum portfolio
      shown in the figure above on the efficient frontier at the level
      of 14% return.
    </p>

    <p>
      The optimum portfolio provides the same return as the S&P assets
      (14%) at a much lower risk (12.9% compared with 18.5%). Note
      however that this is accomplished by short selling Canadian,
      Emerging Markets and Europe, at a total level of
      leveraging<sup style="font-size:xx-small"><a href="#note2">[2]</a></sup>
      of 27.1%. Higher levels of return would generate even greater
      number of short sales. Indeed, in this example, that is the
      mechanism by which the optimum portfolios can provide returns
      superior to 18% at risk levels less than 26%, the marks which
      one would obtain by holding only Pacific.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      With that in mind, it is natural to try to incorporate into the
      portfolio optimization procedure some type of constraint on the
      level of leveraging. One can do that individually, per asset, or
      globally. In the next section we adopt the latter type of
      constraint on the global level of leveraging.
    </p>
      

    <h2>Limiting Leverage</h2>

    <p>
      Contrary to what happens in the case of an unconstrained
      portfolio, where the efficient frontier had an analytic
      expression that could be readily computed, the introduction of a
      constraint on leveraging leaves one with the task of computing
      the optimum portfolios by using numerical methods. This extra
      complication is however compensated by a more insightful
      efficient frontier. For example, in the next figure we have
      computed the efficient frontier subject to two levels of
      constraints on maximum leveraging:
    </p>

    <img height="600" src="frontier2.jpg" alt="Efficient frontier with
    leverage constraints"/>

    <p>
      The <b>solid green curve</b> is the efficient frontier when the
      total leveraging is <b>constrained to be at most 7%</b>. The
      <b>solid blue curve</b> is the efficient frontier when <b>no
      short sales are allowed</b>. Note that as a result of these
      constraints, the efficient frontier has now shifted and is now a
      finite curve segment in both cases. In particular, when no
      leveraging is permitted one is faced at the extremes with a
      choice of holding either Bonds, for minimum return, or Pacific,
      for maximum return.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note also that the three curves have no point in common. This
      means that no optimum portfolio on the solid red efficient
      frontier has a level of leverage below&nbsp;7%. Yet, as the
      figure illustrates, optimum portfolios with very similar risk
      and return exist throughout most of the interesting range of
      returns, in this case between 8% and 17%, which have leveraging
      levels of 7% and even with no leveraging at all! Again to make a
      point about a specific return level, consider&nbsp;14%. The
      three optimum portfolios indicated in the above figure
      correspond to the weights:
    </p>

    <table>
      <thead>
	<tr>
	  <th/>
	  <th>S&P</th>
	  <th>Bonds</th>
	  <th>Canadian</th>
	  <th>Japan</th>
	  <th>Emerging</th>
	  <th>Pacific</th>
	  <th>Europe</th>
	  <th>Small</th>
	  <th>Standard deviation</th>
	  <th>Leverage</th>
	</tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
	<tr>
	  <th>(%)</th>
	  <td>5.3</td><td>36.9</td><td style="color:red">-3.6</td><td>6.9</td>
	  <td style="color:red">-12.0</td><td>33.7</td><td style="color:red">-11.5</td><td>44.2</td>  
	  <td>12.9</td><td style="color:red">27.1</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <th></th>
	  <td>&mdash;</td><td>31.5</td><td>&mdash;</td><td>3.1</td><td style="color:red">-7.0</td><td>32.5</td><td>&mdash;</td><td>39.9</td><td>13.1</td><td style="color:red">7.0</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <th></th>
          <td>&mdash;</td><td>30.9</td><td>&mdash;</td><td>2.7</td><td>&mdash;</td><td>32.1</td><td>&mdash;</td><td>34.4</td><td>13.4</td><td>&mdash;</td>
	</tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      Note the negligible impact in the standard deviations of these
      optimum portfolios, that is their aggregate risk, as compared
      with the very large variation in the required level of borrowing
      required to holding these portfolios.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      This may be the most significant advantage of improving the
      quality of the underlying model by incorporating in the
      portfolio optimization procedure operational and strategic
      constraints, rather than trying to adapt an optimal solution
      obtained in the unconstrained case to fit practical realities.
    </p>

    <h2>Constraints on Selected Positions</h2>

    <p>
      In the presence of additional constraints the efficient frontier
      will shift further. In this section we consider constraints on
      minimum positions on certain assets. For instance, let us look
      for optimum portfolios in which <b>at least 30% of the total
      investment is in S&P and at least 10% is in Bonds</b>. The
      efficient frontier is now computed and displayed in the next
      figure under <b>arbitrary leverage (solid magenta)</b>, <b>7%
      (solid green)</b> or <b>no leverage (solid blue)</b>
      constraints. For reference the fully <b>unconstrained</b> efficient
      frontier is also shown in <b>solid red</b>.
    </p>
      
    <img height="600" src="frontier3.jpg" alt="Efficient frontier with
    leverage constraints"/>

    <p>
      Note how enforcing minimum positions in S&P and Bonds
      significantly reduce the range of returns available at the
      efficient frontier, specially when combined with leverage
      constraints (blue and green curves). Yet, just as before, in the
      case of leverage constraints alone, optimum portfolios are
      available that are very close to the original unconstrained
      efficient frontier in most of the feasible range. Once again,
      consider the return level of 14%. Four optimum portfolios in
      each of the efficient frontiers depicted above are shown in the
      next table.
    </p>

    <table>

	<tr>
	  <th></th>
	  <td>30.0</td><td>34.8</td><td style="color:red">-8.7</td><td>10.0</td><td style="color:red">-9.8</td><td>30.8</td><td style="color:red">-18.5</td><td>31.4</td><td>13.1</td><td style="color:red">37.0</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <th></th>
	  <td>30.0</td><td>23.2</td><td>&mdash;</td><td>6.2</td><td style="color:red">-2.6</td><td>27.4</td><td style="color:red">-4.4</td><td>20.2</td><td>13.5</td><td style="color:red">7.0</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <th></th>
	  <td>30.0</td><td>21.2</td><td>&mdash;</td><td>4.7</td><td>&mdash;</td><td>26.8</td><td>&mdash;</td><td>17.3</td><td>13.8</td><td>&mdash;</td>
	</tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      One more time, the increased risk (standard deviation of the
      return) is insignificant if compared with the variation in the
      amount of short sales as we enforce leverage constraints jointly
      with minimum positions on S&P and Bonds. Note that for the 14%
      return level the 30% minimum in S&P is active (that means
      satisfied at the required minimum) on all three optimum
      portfolios whereas the optimal withholding of Bonds is always
      greater than the required minimum. At higher levels of return
      the 15% constraint on Bonds becomes active as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      It might come as a surprise to some to observe that the optimum
      portfolio obtained with no constraint on leveraging but where
      the minimum holdings on S&P and Bonds are enforced actually
      (solid magenta) produces the highest number of short sales,
      raising the required overall leveraging by almost 40% (from
      27.1% to 37.0%). The conclusion is once again that one should
      incorporate as many practical constraints as possible on the
      underlying portfolio model in order to obtain reasonable and
      meaningful portfolios.
